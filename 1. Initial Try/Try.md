# Initial Try

In the `Try.java` file, the loop is attempting to print out all consecutive pairs of numbers in the `nums` array, but is producing an error. Can you fix it so that it prints out the pairs without an error?

Hint: Run the file and read to the error to get a better sense of what the issue is!

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
